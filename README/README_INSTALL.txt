This scenery includes a smallish area around SVMI.
More airports in the works soon!

Just merge this into data/scenery, replacing the files....

It will NOT work if you replace TerraSync data with these files (or if you use TerraSync).
My paths are as such:
C:/Users/ME/Documents/My Folder/FlightGear/data/Scenery/
and I just copy/pasted/overwrote the files.
